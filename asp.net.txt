ASP.NET:
this technology is for the server
IAS- Server
Browser-Client

Request response architecture..

EXTENSION- .aspx (web form file)
	   .aspx.cs (code behind file)

code behind file- having all the event handlers and designs on the same file

<%@......%> -page directive

Controls- client site control(machine is having the code)

	- server site control(when i click on button...it is happening in the server site )
(application is not in our machine...it works or runs in server because code is in the server)
<asp:
runat server

go to designs at the bottom to add button

POST BACK-
Going to the server and server yields a value back
(post and return back)

Rendering- when page is available to display 

Load will run after the design time.
 so items added in design will display first and then if more things added on load it will also display

After load the priority is event handler
so, event handler message will be displayed and label1 text will be overridden

S Request start
I Initialize
L Load
V Validations
E Event Handlers
R Rendering
U Unload

VIEW STATE-

http protocol is stateless so asp view state does a lot of things to maintain its state
(it makes the asp dot net a bit heavy)

Disabling ViewState for controls-
(Data will be less, lighter round trip)

If we disable the viewstate, dn label will take the default message as set in the design view

Whenever i change the value in the control it should hit the server

cb.SelectedItem.Value
cb.SelectedItem.Text

Auto PostBack

For error in form change in app config,
<configuration>
<appSettings>
<add key="ValidationSettings:Unobtrusive Validation Mode" value="None">
<add>
</appSettings>
</configuration>


private void addRemove(ListBox ListBox1, ListBox ListBox2)
{
if(ListBox1.SelectedIndex != -1)
{
foreach(ListItem li in ListBox1.Items)
{
if(li.Selected)
{
ListBox2.Items.Add(li);
}
}

foreach(ListItem li in ListBox2.Items)
{
ListBox1.Items.Remove(li.value);
}
Label1.Text="";
ListBox2.ClearSelection();
}
else
{
}
}
then call methods in the button clicks of listbox
