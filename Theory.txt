Default Web site home- IIS
C-Drive - inetpub(if there then IIS is installed)- wwwroot(website hosting)
deployment or publishing the web file
Right click on application and publish.

localhost/_______ (where it will find the file?? it will go to the wwwroot amd search for the file)

http Handler 
http modules

to run the web page, extension is  .aspx
who handles the aspx request??? 
in IIS, the .aspx is mapped through an APPLICATION EXTENSIOM THAT IS MAPPED TO the asp.net ISAPI dll


Every request that fires asp.net must go through an extension that is registered and points at aspnet_isapi.dll

%windir\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\aspnet_isapi.dll

HttpModule vs HttpHandler-

HttpHandler is the process which runs in response to http request
.aspx web page
.asmx web service
.asax web user control
.axd handler that displays trace information

for any request, there can be multiple modules in between pipeline to reach the handler
Httpmodules are plugged in to request life cycle.
modules may be authentication, security, authorization, logging etc

IIS 5 hosts aspnet_isapi dll directly in the inetinfo.exe process
In IIS 6, the worker process is w3wp.exe.

Application pool is the container of worker process.
In application pool there are application domains.
Application Pool is used to separatesets of IIS worker processes that share the
same configuration(web.config)

Deployment- Publishing on IIS 
Virtual Directory

AutoEventWireup-

When AutoEventWireup is true, handlers are automatically bound to events at run time
based on their name and signature. For each event, ASP.NET searches for a method
that is named according to the pattern Page_eventname, such as Page_Load or Page_Init.

onClick- handler binding

Code declaration block-
<script runat ="server">

Code render block
<% %>

machine.config machine level,
web.config application or part level

use of global.aspx-

Global.asax is an optional file which is used to handle higher level application events
such as Application_Start, Application_End, Session_Start, Session_End etc.
It is also popularly known as ASP.NET Application File. 
This file resides in the root directory of an ASP.NET-based application.

Tracing and debugging

<system.web>
<compilation debug="false">
</system.web>

home-> customer-> add customer

sitemap breadcrumb

web.sitemap

add treeview

Server.Transfer("webpage2.aspx") for redirection between same application pages(inside the application)
     vs
Response.Redirect("webpage2.aspx") for redirecting to any url(outside the application)

Unobstrusive validation-
prior to asp.net 4.5 validation controls automatically creates lot of javascript code 
for client side validation, now these are added as attribute to controls tags rather than code

UnobstrusivevalidationMode WebForms or none(for older version)

Repeater vs GridView / Form View
Repeater is light weight
Templates- (alternate template- color change)

The Repeater and GridView controls are used differently. 
A GridView control is used when you want to display a set of data in a table format. 
A Repeater is when you want to display data repeatedly, but not necessarily in a tabular format. 
If you want a table, use a GridView, otherwise use a Repeater.

GridView - Read/Edit

DataList - Read/Edit

Repeater - Read Only

DetailsView - Read/Edit/Create

FormView - Read/Edit/Create



Session vs application(not thread safe) vs cache(thread safe)
